    On the periodic table, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead'>lead</a>
    is among the most dense metals. Lead as a material
    has been around in our society for millenia. Since the beginning of civilization,
    it has been used for cosmetics, fishing, and currency. Plumbing derives from the use of
    lead for the pipes based on the Latin name for lead, <em>plumbum</em>.
</p>

<p>
    Today, our understanding of lead is much different. Research has shown that lead
    can be a toxic material if it enters our body. Lead poisoning is caused when lead blocks
    enzymes from properly functioning in your body, causing a slow and disturbing death.
</p>

<p>
    However, lead is still an important material in our society. By keeping its usage restricted,
    we have been able to continue using it to great advantage. Lead's density as a material has
    made it useful in a number of fields including radiation shielding.
</p>

<p>
    Strong types of radiation, such as x-rays, can be fatal if you're exposed for a long time.
    However, when you get x-rays you wear a lead apron, as lead is able to block it and protect you.
</p>

<p>
    In Dungeons and Dragons, lead is noted in some spells as acting like a barrier. The spell for
    <a href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic'>Detect Magic</a>, notes that the spell
    is blocked by "a thin sheet of lead".
</p>

<p>
    In a session, lead may serve as a novel challenge for a magic-heavy party. Players that are used
    to casting spells to solve every puzzle may become puzzled as their spells become ineffective. This
    may happen in a dwarven village, underground as a natural mineral, or used as a special pendant that
    is worn by an antagonist in order to protect themselves from magic.
</p>

<p>
    In a village built near a high concentration of lead, players may feel uncomfortable just
    as they enter. They may feel oddly weaker, as their spells may not have a regular effect
    anywhere as they're in the area. Villagers may understand it is due to the metal, or they
    may see it as a divine protection.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, villagers may be subtlely affected by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning'>
    lead poisoning</a>. There are many visible symptoms that can be incorporated into NPCs to give
    them more unique personalities.

    <ul>
        <li>Short-term memory loss</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Slurred speech</li>
        <li>Blue gums</li>
        <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    These small details may go unnoticed by players, but they create a more realistic world. By
    adding in these details, your sessions will become more immersive and cathartic.
